# Readings Systems
A readings system is a romanization system implemented in such a way that instead of being limited to yielding just one romanization value for a character, can return every known reading for every single character.

This is a package-specific detail, but it allows you to do with the readings how you please. If you'd rather just get *a* reading, these systems still support the basic [Process](/Romanization.NET/api/Romanization.IRomanizationSystem#Romanization_IRomanizationSystem_Process_System_String_)
function.

If you're looking for the API Documentation for them, you can find it [here](/Romanization.NET/api/Romanization.IReadingsRomanizationSystem-1).
