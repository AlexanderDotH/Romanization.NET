[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A small library for romanization of widely-used languages using common romanization systems.

Still a work in progress. Originally made as part of the [NUSRipper](https://github.com/zedseven/NusRipper) project.

The languages currently supported are:
| Language       | Romanization Systems |
| :------------- | :------------------: |
| Japanese       | [Modified Hepburn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepburn_romanization) |
